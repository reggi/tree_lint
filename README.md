# tree lint

This is a command-line tool. Its job is to help you organize your TypeScript projects. The philosophy of the structure is to allow you to keep all relevant files within the same hierarchy node so it's easy to break it out into its own repository. The rules for how the directories/projects work are as follows:

1. Each dir is a "project".
2. Each project can contain whatever files you want. The convention is ideally a single `mod.ts`, `test.ts` etc file.
3. Dependents of the project live as a sibling next to its `mod.ts` in a folder and so on, building a hierarchy.
4. Projects that are not used by any other project will be at the top of the tree.
5. Projects with only one usage should be nested within that project.
6. Projects that are used by more than one project are placed as a sibling of the highest (top-most) project in the tree.
7. Circular projects will be siblings.

> Note: nothing is written to disk. All that is used is the read permission `--allow-read`.

## How it works

Using `walk`, the project is scanned, and TypeScript files are crudely parsed using a string match for imports (nothing fancy). Each TypeScript file in the project is read and builds up a local dependency map. Here's this project's initial dependency scan:

```json
{
  "deep_traverse": [],
  "depth_first_search": [
    "process_deps"
  ],
  "parse_imports": [],
  "process_deps": [
    "depth_first_search",
    "deep_traverse",
    "shared_prefix"
  ],
  "read_project": [
    "parse_imports"
  ],
  "shared_prefix": [],
  "tree_lint": [
    "process_deps",
    "parse_imports",
    "read_project"
  ]
}
```

Using the dependency map, we build up what the relationships should be for this project.

```json
{
  "tree_lint": {
    "depth_first_search": {},
    "parse_imports": {},
    "process_deps": {
      "deep_traverse": {},
      "shared_prefix": {}
    },
    "read_project": {}
  }
}
```

The tool will "lint" that the folder structure of the project matches the projection. If so, "all good üëç ‚úÖ". If not, you have to move files and folders around manually to get them to match.
